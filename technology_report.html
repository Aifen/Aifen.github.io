      <h3>Improvements over the S8:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Repositioned the fingerprint scanner to the center back</li>
        <li>Enhanced audio capability with stereo speakers, tuned by AKG</li>
        <li>Improved the excellent camera experience</li>
        <li>Improved the facial unlock and security experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p> With very few improvements over the S8 that most users would notice or take advantage of, the S9 is targetted towards 
those who have a phone that is several generations old, and those who seek the improved camera features. 
If you were planning tomake the switch from another phone such as an Iphone or a Pixel, now is the time to make the switch.</p>
      <h3>How well will it perform:</h3>
      <p>With every release of a new piece of technology, many will wonder if it will perform well or flop. With just the branding 
recognition of 'Samsung' it is near guranteed that the Samsung Galaxy S9 will perform well, and with a pricing that is
less than its competitors, and technology that is upto par with its competitors,</p>
