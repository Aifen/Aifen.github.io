      <h3>Arsene Wenger: Arsenal manager says keeping his job is his 'last worry'</h3>

      <p>Arsene Wenger says keeping his job as Arsenal boss is his "last worry" after losing six of their 12 games in 2018. The Gunners host leaders Manchester City in the Premier League on Thursday, four days after a 3-0 defeat by City in the Carabao Cup
        final at Wembley. Arsenal are 27 points behind City and 10 adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for a Champions League place. Wenger, Arsenal manager since 1996, said he is "amazed I still have to answer these kinds of questions". The
        68-year-old Frenchman signed a new two-year contract in May 2017 after leading Arsenal to a third FA Cup triumph in four seasons, although they missed out on Champions League qualification for the first time in 20 years. "I've turned the whole
        world down to respect my contracts," he added. "My position is the last worry I have at the moment. My worry is to get the team focused and ready for tomorrow's game." On Thursday, sixth-placed Arsenal play their game in hand over Tottenham and
        if they win they will be seven points behind their north London rivals - and five behind fifth-placed Chelsea - with 10 matches remaining. Winning the Europa League is another route into the Champions League and Arsenal face AC Milan in the last
        16. Wenger has faced increased scrutiny over his position in recent seasons, and former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said on BBC Radio 5 live he "could not make a case" for the Frenchman to remain as manager beyond the end of this season. But a
        defiant Wenger once again hit back at questions over his future in a media conference on Wednesday. "My job is to focus on performing and it's for other people to judge me," he said. "Does it stop you sleeping that my position is certain or uncertain?
        The game on Thursday night is the important thing." "It's not always possible to win games. We have to live with the criticism, it's part of the modern game. But we have to focus on the next one and respond together in a united way."

      <h3>Westgarth death felt across boxing but the sport will continue</h3>

        Another death, another rancorous debate. Scott Westgarth, a 31-year-old light-heavyweight who came to boxing late and left it too early, has died after winning the 10th fight of his short professional career. He will have no say in the agonised discussions
        to follow, except as collateral evidence. Rolling bulletins on Monday morning – some of them brief mentions tacked on to the affairs of state and passing concern about the worsening weather – generated the first wave of familiar sadness and predictable
        controversy. The sport rose as one to laud a warrior, whether the defenders knew Westgarth well or not, because they understand the sacrifices and dangers of their calling better than the abolitionists they realised would soon be added to the
        noise. Westgarth and Scunthorpe’s Dec Spelman, the unbeaten 26-year-old favourite, each hit the floor in a hard, close contest. But the older man got up in the 10th to prevail against the odds, 95-92. The unclaimed prize was a shot at the English
        title, a minor belt that can lead to bigger nights. Westgarth finished his ringside interview, later collapsed and was taken to hospital. He did not recover, joining more than 500 pugilists in the long history of the sport whohave given up their
        lives in the ring. Mike Towell was the last British boxer to die from boxing injuries, the day after losing to Dale Evans in Glasgow in September, 2016. Saturday night’s promoter, Stefy Bull, described Westgarth as, “a young man doing a job he
        loves”. Very few don’t love it, even those who are damaged by it. Michael Watson was sometimes seen ringside at fights in his wheelchair years after he emerged from his 1991 bout with Chris Eubank a shell of the fine fighter he once was; Spencer
        Oliver, who spent a week in a coma after his last fight, in 1998, is an articulate and passionate commentator still; Nick Blackwell, sadly, was so enchanted by the calling he came back from a coma induced by his dreadful experience against Chris
        Eubank’s son, Junior, in 2016, to spar again, to the alarm of everyone. Kevin Mitchell of IrishTimes

      <h3>Bruins' Patrice Bergeron sidelined with fractured right foot</h3>
      <img src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4553855.1519753736!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/patrice-bergeron.jpg?imwidth=720">
      <p>Boston Bruins star centre Patrice Bergeron has a fractured right foot and will be evaluated in two weeks, the team announced Tuesday. The 32-year-old suffered the injury while blocking a shot during the Bruins' 4-3 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs
        last Saturday and was spotted leaving the arena wearing a walking boot. Bergeron returned Sunday and played through "some discomfort" in a 4-1 loss to Buffalo before a CT scan on Monday revealed a small fracture. Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy
        said “It’s gonna hurt...but we’ve been through this early in the year with guys stepping up. Not one guy will replace Bergy.” Bergeron of L'Ancienne-Lorette was in the midst of one of the best seasons in his 14-year NHL career with 54 points in
        55 games. Riley Nash is expected to replace Bergeron on the team's top line.</p>
